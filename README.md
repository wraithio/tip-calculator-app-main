Create a tip Calculator from the FrontEndMentor starter 

Peer Review: Thao Vang
"Everything looks good everything is functioning good, the buttons all work as shown or how i assume they should work based on images. very nit picky things can be that in desktop version the title "splitter" seems to have a too much space above it than under it. at certain widths ~680px-650px things start to squish, maybe just change the media query size a tad bit sooner so it changes at a higher px count. Overall good job."
